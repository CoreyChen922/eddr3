ddr3 subproject for Elphel 393 camera

This subproject is started to create a DDR3 memory controller for Elphel camera that does not depend on any non-documented
features of Xilinx Zynq and can be simulated by Free Software tools (Icarus Verilog + GTKWave) without use of any encrypted
modules. Everything in plain Verilog and constraints.
